# Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) Setup for SQL Server

This script demonstrates the setup of Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for a SQL Server database. TDE helps protect data at rest by encrypting the database files.




## Usage

1. Run the provided SQL script in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any SQL query tool.
2. Follow the comments in the script to understand each step of the TDE setup process.
3. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the script and perform TDE operations.
## Important Notes

- TDE requires the use of a master key and certificate for encryption and decryption.
- Make sure to securely store and backup the certificate and private key to avoid data loss.
- Always test TDE setup and operations in a non-production environment before implementing in production.

For detailed documentation on TDE in SQL Server, refer to the official [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption?view=sql-server-ver15).
